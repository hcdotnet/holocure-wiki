# Translating

The HoloCure wiki is written English-first, but support for other languages is encouraged and sought after.

Before continuing, ensure you have read the [contributing guide](/docs/meta/contributing.md).

When contributing a new language, it is requested (but not required) that you add the language in a pull request before actually getting started on your specific page translations.

## Adding a new language

If the language you are looking to contribute is not yet supported, you will have to register it.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
    ...
    i18n: {
        defaultLocale: 'en',
        locales: ['en', '<your-locale>'],
    },
    ...
}
```

## Translating a page

Assuming you are translating a page that lies within the `/docs/` directory, you can safely copy the file to the corresponding directory within the `/i18n/<your-locale>/` directory (create `/<your-locale>/` if it does not yet exist).

## Testing your translations

Once you are ready to test a translation, you can start the site on the locale you are working on:

```bash
npm run start -- --locale <your-locale>
```

:::caution

In development, you can only use one locale at the time. Production builds do not have this limit.

:::

Once you have started the site, your translations will be live at [http://localhost:3000/&lt;your-locale&gt;/](http://localhost:3000/<your-locale>/).

## Build your translations

Once you have finished your translations, you will want to build the site with your translations included.

```bash
npm run build -- --locale <your-locale>
```

You can also build the entire site with all locales:

```bash
npm run build
```

:::info

Unlike development builds, production builds are not limited to only a single locale.
