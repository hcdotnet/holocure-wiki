# About

The HoloCure Wiki is a community-driven, free, and open-source project hosted at [hcdotnet/holocure-wiki](https://github.com/hcdotnet/holocure-wiki).

We focus on documenting practical gameplay knowledge relevant to players (i.e. weapons, gameplay guides, etc.) as well as technical documentation more relevant to developers (i.e. modding, internal game mechanics, file formats). These two categories are kept separate as to not confuse regular users.

## Contributing

Since this wiki is entirely community-driven, we rely on the goodwill contributions of players to keep it up-to-date and relevant.

If you would like to contribute, please see the [contributing guide](/docs/meta/contributing.md).
