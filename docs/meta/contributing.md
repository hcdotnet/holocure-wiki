# Contributing

Since this wiki is entirely community-driven, we rely on the goodwill contributions of players to keep it up-to-date and relevant.

Contributions, as well as discussion, occur on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hcdotnet/holocure-wiki) for this wiki.

## Making a Contribution

To make a contribution, you will need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for free](https://github.com). Once you have an account, you can either [create an issue](https://github.com/hcdotnet/holocure-wiki/issues/new) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/hcdotnet/holocure-wiki/compare) to the repository. Read further for more information on these two options.

You can submit your changes by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository, making your changes, and [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

If you do not want to contribute directly to the wiki or you simply are not able to or don not have the time, you can still help by [creating an issue](https://github.com/hcdotnet/holocure-wiki/issues/new) and detailing what information you would like to see, any errors you have found, or any other suggestions you may have.

## Style Guide

An exhaustive style guide is pending—and may never be fully written—but here are some general guidelines to follow:

- use American English spelling,
- use serial commas (Oxford commas),
- use sentence case for headings,
- write pages in Markdown (`.md`), only use Markdown React (`.mdx`) when necessary,
  - don't use TypeScript React (`.tsx`).
